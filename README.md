Snorocket
=========

This project contains three modules:

* snorocket-core: This is the core classifier code.
* snorocket-owlapi: An implementation of the OWLReasoner interface based on Snorocket.
* snorocket-protege: The implementation of the Snorocket Protege plugin.

Version 3.0.0 reverts back to depending on OWL-API 4.x to regain compatibility with Protege
